This website is based on Jekyll, Bootstrap CSS and a custom CSS. There aren't many features but pretty enough for a simple blog. I want the simplest blog ever with some functionality (which bootstrap provides). I have my blog's full source on my Github but for someone who wants to use this theme without tinkering I have made it easy. Just clone [this](https://github.com/shijuleon/Bootyll) repo and go online. I'm not going to explain what is included in this, just clone it and find it.
